# Medical Chatbot Implementation

## Training Process Management
- Always check if training is already in progress before starting a new training session
- Use a global flag (modelTrainingInProgress) to track training state
- Properly export isTrainingInProgress() method from AIService
- Reset the training flag when training completes or fails
- Implement auto-training on first load when models aren't detected

## TensorFlow.js Memory Management
- Always dispose tensors after use to prevent memory leaks
- Clean up tensors in both success and error paths
- Be especially careful with tensors created in loops
- Use tf.tidy() for complex operations when appropriate
- Dispose model predictions after extracting data

## Model Saving and Loading
- Save models to multiple locations for redundancy
- Handle model loading failures gracefully with fallbacks
- Check model existence before attempting to use them
- Provide clear error messages when models aren't available
- Save models immediately after successful training

## Autonomous Learning Implementation
- Implement proper fine-tuning with each interaction
- Create mock targets for all output heads during fine-tuning
- Use small batch sizes (1) and epochs (1) for incremental learning
- Run learning operations asynchronously to avoid blocking UI
- Track learning state to provide visual feedback to users

## Error Handling
- Catch and log errors during model operations
- Provide fallback responses when model operations fail
- Include detailed error information in console logs
- Reset state properly after errors to prevent cascading failures
- Implement graceful degradation when models aren't available
