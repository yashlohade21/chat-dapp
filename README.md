   - MetaMask integration for secure authentication

2. **User Management**
   - Wallet-based authentication using MetaMask
   - Custom username creation and profile management
   - Friend system with add/remove capabilities
   - User discovery and friend requests

3. **Messaging System**
   - Direct peer-to-peer messaging
   - Real-time message delivery
   - Message history stored on blockchain
   - Timestamp-based message ordering

4. **Smart Contract Features**
   - User registration and profile management
   - Friend list management
   - Message storage and retrieval
   - Privacy-focused message routing

5. **Frontend Features**
   - React-based responsive UI
   - Real-time message updates
   - Friend list management interface
   - User search and discovery
   - Analytics dashboard

### Technical Stack

1. **Blockchain Layer**
   - Solidity smart contracts
   - Hardhat development environment
   - Polygon Amoy testnet deployment
   - Web3.js for blockchain interactions

2. **Frontend Layer**
   - Next.js framework
   - React for UI components
   - Context API for state management
   - CSS modules for styling

3. **Authentication**

This decentralized chat application represents a significant step forward in secure, private communication systems, particularly for healthcare applications. By leveraging blockchain technology and modern web development practices, it provides a robust platform for confidential message exchange while maintaining user privacy and data security.

The application's architecture ensures that messages and user data are stored on the blockchain, making the system resistant to censorship and central points of failure. The integration with MetaMask provides a secure authentication mechanism, while the React-based frontend delivers a smooth and intuitive user experience.
